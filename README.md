# Scenario to use odo and a Spring Boot application

## PREREQUISITES 

- Minishift `3.9` using Centos ISO `1.9.0` as we can't install image from red hat registry using latest centos distro `(> 1.9.0)` due to a missing Red Hat CA Cert not installed locally and available for docker to pull images from Red Hat Registry server 
- `admin-user` addon installed.

## Instructions

- [Install odo](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo#installation) on Macos

  ```bash
  sudo sh -c 'curl -L https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/releases/download/v0.0.6/odo-darwin-amd64.gz | gzip -d > /usr/local/bin/odo; chmod +x /usr/local/bin/odo'
  ```

- Next, git clone the following Spring Boot project
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/snowdrop/ocp-odo-build-install.git && cd ocp-odo-build-install
  ```

- Log on to OpenShift and create a new project

  ```bash
  oc login $(minishift ip):8443 -u admin -p admin
  oc new-project ocp-odo-build-install
  ```
 
- Install the official Red Hat OpenJDK-1.8 S2I Build Image using this command : 
  ```bash
  oc import-image openjdk18 --from=registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift --confirm -n openshift
  ```
  
  **REMARK** : Next patch it to add the missing `builder` annotation
  ```bash
  oc patch is/openjdk18 -n openshift -p '{"spec":{"$setElementOrder/tags":[{"name":"latest"}],"tags":[{"annotations":{"openshift.io/display-name":"OpenJDK 1.8","tags":"builder"},"name":"latest"}]}}Ë€
  ```
  
- Create a new SpringBoot's odo component which means, create a new application, buildConfig, DeploymentConfig & Service

  ```bash
  odo create openjdk18 sb1 --git https://github.com/snowdrop/ocp-odo-build-install.git
  ```

  **WARNING** : The deployment of the pod will fail as a [missing ENV var](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/501) is not declared to specify the uberjar file to be used. Then apply the following env var oc command on the `BuildConfig` resource and restart the build:

  ```
  ctrl-c
  oc cancel-build sb1-1
  oc env bc/sb1 ARTIFACT_COPY_ARGS=*-exec.jar 
  oc start-build sb1
  ```

- Cleanup
  ```bash
  oc delete all --all
  oc delete pvc/openjdk18-s2idata
  ```  
  
**Steps**
 
- During the execution of the `odo create openjdk18 --git` command, the following resources will be created: imageStream, buildConfig, deploymentConfig and service
- Next, a pod will be created, a supervisord added to be able to call the service requesting to compile and next to restart the microservice (= java -jar)
- The code is git cloned (or pushed), then the s2i script responsible to do the mvn compilation will take place.
- When the compilation is finished, then the script `assemble-and-restart` is called by the supervisord
- The microservices is (re)started
